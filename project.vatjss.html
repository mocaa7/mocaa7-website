            VATJSS is a non-profit organization focusing on transformative justice. Contrary to traditional justice, which focuses on punishment, they view justice with the true meaning of equality:
            <br />
            <br />
            What is the best way to provide equality given a group's set of circumstances and history?
            <br />
            What is most beneficial to the person and society?
        </p>
        <p>
            To reach the users, we need to understand their mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, the VATJSS website was redesigned to:
        </p>
        <p class="left indent">
            1) Accurately represent their services
            <br />
            2) Provide easy access to services and resources
            <br />
            3) Build trust with the user base

        <p>
            The design should accurately represent VATJSS services, provide users easy access to their services and resources, and build trust with the user base.

        <h1>The Clients</h1>
        <p>
            VATJSS is up and running because of staff who genuinely care about the cause.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the aboriginals' history of mistreatment, which still affects them today, they believe that — subject to the type of crime committed — transformative justice is a better alternative for the community.

        <p>
            VATJSS services are open to the aboriginal community in Vancouver.
            <br />
            We interviewed 8 users, and surveyed 11.

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>How they best learn:</strong> by visuals and little text<br />
            <strong>Expectation:</strong> housing information<br />
            <strong>Trust:</strong> see that it is tied to the community through photos of staff &amp; contact info<br />
            <strong>Device:</strong> most access the internet through their phone<br />
            <strong>Where they seek legal information:</strong> primarily online<br />
            <strong>Motivation for finding resources:</strong> usually "immediate assistance"
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Difficulty for users to understand the material and to find content.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Ensure the content is accessible to users:</strong>
            both intelligibly — through appropriate language and incorporating methods they learn best by, and physically — so the site is clear on any device (mobile, desktop, tablet).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Build trust with users:</strong>
            the website should communicate empathy with what the community has gone through, without prejudice or discrimination.
        </p>
        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>
            This storyboard shows how an accessible website can assist users in understanding more about transformative justice and VATJSS services.

            We created a new information architecture intuitive for users to navigate.

        <p>
            The goal was to reduce information overload and make it easy for users to access information they are looking for.

        <p>
            We created a "this and not that" list which identifies the mood and tone that the website should communicate. "This" indicates the tone we want to communicate, "not" is the opposite, and "yet" stabilizes the trait.

            We tested the mid-fi desktop prototype with 7 people.

            We wanted them to get in the mindset of the user and their specific situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before each task, we set up common user scenarios to describe the environment and situation that a user may be in when accessing the site.
        </p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
        <p>
            Scenario: the landlord wants to evict you, and you want to find a way to deal with the situation.
            <br />
            Task: <strong>find a contact to mediate with the landlord.</strong>
