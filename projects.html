                VenturX aims to tackle the issue that 90% of startups fail in their first
                year. Sydney Wong (the founder) and her team created an analytics
                tool to help early-stage startups launch and connect to funding.

                The first step in drawing people to this web app is to build a

                <br/>

            <h1>Setting the KPIs</h1>
            <p>
                Sydney had a vision for VenturX.
                <br/>
                She knew that without growth of her user base, VenturX would eventually die down.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Sydney hoped to increase the sign up <i>conversion rate from 4% to 50%.</i>

            <div class="left">
                <h2>Evaluating the Original KPIs</h2>
                <p>
                    With my team, we discovered that <strong>4% refers to about 1.5 persons per week.</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Although 1.5 persons is not a lot, a 4% conversion rate is above average.
                    <br/>
                    <p class="center">
                        <i>What KPI that will maximize impact for VenturX?</i>
                    </p>
                    To answer this, we spent time testing the <a href="#">existing website</a> for insight on the user.
                </p>
                <h2>The Existing Website</h2>
                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    Users are confused about what VenturX is;
                    <br/>
                    the landing page does not provide enough information.
                </p>
                <h3>Testing of Current Website</h3>
                <p>
                    To test our hypothesis, we tested the existing website to find user pain-points, and where they were dropping off.
                    <br/>
                    <p class="center">
                        Users were confused about what VenturX was.

                        "I am not sure what the dashboard metrics are measuring."

                <p>
                    Users experienced the following <strong>pain-points:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Content lacked in quantity and clarity</li>
                        <li>Visuals were not relevant to the content</li>
                        <li>Call to action (CTA) buttons were not placed conveniently</li>
                        <li>The demo video added confusionâ€”users not sure how the tool works</li>
                        <li>Who is the audience? Entrepreneurs? Incubators? Accelerators?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>New KPIs</h2>
                <p>
                    Since there were only around 10 website visitors per week, we found
                    that <strong>increasing user acquisition</strong> would be most beneficial for VenturX, even if
                    the conversion rate of 4% remains constant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we hoped to increase conversion rate in the long run by providing
                    valuable content that would cause users to return and eventually sign-up.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Educate and convince users to join VenturX</li>
                        <li>Create a fun and enjoyable experience on the website</li>
                    </ul>
