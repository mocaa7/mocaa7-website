                    <i>I approach new designs like a child approaches the world: asking WHY. Their thoughts are free from assumptions that we often take for granted. However, we are inevitably biased. A clear perspective means evaluating the presence of our biases and how they are affecting our designs, and ultimately, our thoughts.</i>

            <i>UX is everywhere. With my experience as a distress services volunteer and peer supporter, I was dealing with a diversity of people. Every person has their own model of the world, and consequently, their own biases. Support meant sensitivity to the unknown: their subjective experiences. I had to capture my biases and acknowledge their presence. That is the key to open-mindedness.</i>

            <i>I love making new connections with concepts I learn and bridging fields together (such as philosophy, linguistics, computer science and psychology). In making such connections, I saw how the boundaries between the sciences and arts are blurred; my findings are observations are expressed in a way that is meaningful for people. That's how I approach the design process.</i>
