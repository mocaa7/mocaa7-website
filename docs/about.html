                    I attended the <strong>University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Systems</strong>. Upon graduation, I completed a <strong>full-time UX Design program at RED Academy</strong> and worked on several projects thereafter. I then completed a <strong>Masters of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University</strong>. I was interested in the computer science field because it uses both creative and technical skills, through design and problem solving. What I find sets CS apart from other fields is that you can build programs from almost nothing. It is so rewarding to see your impact almost immediately.

However, because we are inevitably biased, a clear perspective means evaluating the presence of our biases and how they are affecting our designs, and ultimately, our thoughts.</i></p>

            <i>I love making new connections with concepts I learn and bridging fields together (such as philosophy, linguistics, computer science and psychology). In making such connections, I saw how the boundaries between the sciences and arts are blurred; my findings and observations are expressed in a way that is meaningful for people. That's how I approach the design process.</i>
