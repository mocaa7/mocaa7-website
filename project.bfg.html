            BFG is a weight neutral fitness app for plus-size women. Contrary to other fitness apps, "success" is measured with metrics that exclude weight. It creates an encouraging environment for users to thrive in their fitness lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            To design an effective app, we need to understand the ideal environment for these women to thrive in their fitness lives.

            In this project, the BFG app was designed to:
            <br />
            (1) Encourage plus-size women to exercise
            <br />
            (2) Increase self-confidence through a positive mindset
            <br />
            (3) Build a support network
