            BFG is a weight neutral fitness app for plus-size women. Contrary to other fitness apps, "success" is measured with metrics that exclude weight. It creates an encouraging environment for users to thrive in their fitness lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            To design an effective app, we need to understand the ideal environment for these women to thrive in their fitness lives.
        </p>
        <p class="left indent">
            In this project, the BFG app was designed to:
            <br />
            (1) Encourage plus-size women to exercise
            <br />
            (2) Increase self-confidence through a positive mindset
            <br />
            (3) Build a support network

        <h1>The User</h1>
        <p>
            Primary audience: plus-size women already part of their Facebook BFG group.
            <br />
            We interviewed 7 users.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <img src="assets/bfg/research-results.svg" alt="research findings" />
        <p>
            <strong>Best motivated by:</strong> a supportive community
            <br />
            <strong>Exercise goals:</strong> personal/internal fulfillment
            <br />
            <strong>Ideal fitness environment:</strong> authentic, individually tailored, health focused
            <br />
            <strong>Motivators:</strong> approach oriented, positivity
            <br />
            <strong>Mindset:</strong> self-acceptance, positivity
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Want to keep fit, healthy and confident through support.
        </p>
        <p class="special-quote">
            Being there for you, not being there for calorie burn and it doesn't matter who you are but... everybody works at their own pace, and everybody does what they want to do. So just trying to encourage people in the most positive way and get them to work wherever their level is.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mika is part of the BFG Facebook page. She loves its vibes and can relate with its members. She wants to form a workout group with BFG members in her city. However, there are too many members to look through.</li>
            <li>Sarah wants to start walking home on the daily. However, she often gets discouraged and wants an accountability group within the BFG community to keep her on track. She feels safe to share her struggles with them.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <div>
            Create an app that can encourage users to exercise:
        </div>
        <p class="left indent">
            (1) Through community challenges, both online and in-person
            <br />
            (2) By building a postive mindset
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Online community challenges:</strong> Sarah can engage in her own exercise activity while enjoying the support of others through online accountability.
            <br />
            <strong>Meet-up community challenges:</strong> Mika can exercise with locals in her city to whom she can relate; people with a mindset promoted by the BFG brand.
            <br />
            <strong>Building a positive mindset:</strong> this app gets you in a positive mindset from the moment you open it. Language and imagery create positive vibes for the users.

        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>
            In this storyboard, Marely, like many other women, is struggling to conform with the current fitness industry. It shows how the BFG app encourages an environment of positivity and growth, for whatever level you are at. Read more below.
