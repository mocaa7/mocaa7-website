            VenturX aims to tackle the issue that 90% of startups fail in their first
            year. Sydney Wong (the founder) and her team created an analytics
            tool to help early-stage startups launch and connect to funding.

        <p>
            The first step in drawing people to this web app is to build a
            connection with potential users.

            (1) Educate and convince users to join VenturX

            (2) Create a fun and enjoyable experience

            Website should educate and convince users to join VenturX;
            <br/>
            It should increase user acquisition, and the conversion rate in the long run.

        <h1>Setting the KPIs</h1>
        <p>
            Sydney had a vision for VenturX.
            <br/>
            She knew that without growth of her user base, VenturX would eventually die down.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sydney hoped to increase the sign up <i>conversion rate from 4% to 50%.</i>
        </p>
        <div class="left">
            <h2>Evaluating the Original KPIs</h2>
            <p>
                With my team, we discovered that <strong>4% refers to about 1.5 persons per week.</strong>
                <br/>
                Although 1.5 persons is not a lot, a 4% conversion rate is above average.
                <br/>
                <p class="center">
                    <i>What KPI that will maximize impact for VenturX?</i>
                </p>
                To answer this, we spent time testing the <a href="#">existing website</a> for insight on the user.
            </p>
            <h2>The Existing Website</h2>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                Users are confused about what VenturX is;
                <br/>
                the landing page does not provide enough information.
            </p>
            <h3>Testing of Current Website</h3>
            <p>
                To test our hypothesis, we tested the existing website to find user pain-points, and where they were dropping off.
                <br/>
                <p class="center">
                    Users were confused about what VenturX was.
                </p>
                <p class="center quote">
                    "Is it a website analytics tool?"
                    <br/>
                    "I am not sure what the dashboard metrics are measuring."
                </p>
            </p>
            <img src="assets/venturx/thinking-girl.png" alt="Thinking girl" />
            <p>
                Users experienced the following <strong>pain-points:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content lacked in quantity and clarity</li>
                    <li>Visuals were not relevant to the content</li>
                    <li>Call to action (CTA) buttons were not placed conveniently</li>
                    <li>The demo video added confusionâ€”users not sure how the tool works</li>
                    <li>Who is the audience? Entrepreneurs? Incubators? Accelerators?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>New KPIs</h2>
            <p>
                Since there were only around 10 website visitors per week, we found
                that <strong>increasing user acquisition</strong> would be most beneficial for VenturX, even if
                the conversion rate of 4% remains constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we hoped to increase conversion rate in the long run by providing
                valuable content that would cause users to return and eventually sign-up.
                <ul>
                    <li>Educate and convince users to join VenturX</li>
                    <li>Create a fun and enjoyable experience on the website</li>
                </ul>
